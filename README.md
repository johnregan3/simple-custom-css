Instead of using print_scripts() to insert the CSS directly into the HEAD, CSS styles are generated within simple-custom-css.php, then added via wp_enqueue_scripts, so now it will appear in the HEAD as:

		<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yoursite.com/?sccss=1" />

...even though no css file is actually generated.
